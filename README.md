# About the Project
This project is a Python tool I built to automate the process of collecting business information from Google Maps based on location & search terms.

Originally made to help a family business look up nearby beauty salons, but it is easily extendable to any type of business.

Takes a bunch of locations, searches around them, and spits out a clean CSV file with all the info you'd want:

- Name of the Place
- Address
- Phone number
- Star rating

# Why I Built This
This project came out of a real-world need â€” when you're doing local business outreach or research, nobody has time to copy/paste business details one by one.

Learning-wise, this was also a good way for me to practice:

- Working with APIs
- Handling rate limits & pagination
- Structuring clean data exports
- Building simple GUIs for automation tools

# Tech Stack

- Python
- Requests / BeautifulSoup for scraping
- Tkinter for GUI
- CSV for output
